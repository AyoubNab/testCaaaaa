// All the obfuscation and decoding functions have been removed as they are no longer needed.
// The core logic of the script has been preserved and simplified.

// This function was originally named Tp4asN. It constructs and prints a message.
// The original script had complex, unnecessary arguments and default functions.
// This is the simplified version.
function displayMessage(message) {
  const greeting = "Hello ";
  const fullMessage = greeting + message + "!";
  console.log(fullMessage);
}

// The main call of the script.
// The original script decoded the string "Internet User" from a large array
// and passed it to the main function.
displayMessage("Internet User");

// The original script also contained other complex functions like `fiwOdk`, which
// appeared to be a helper for defining properties on objects, and `PZCBiW` which
// was for finding the global object. These are not used in the final, simplified
// logic of printing a message to the console, so they have been removed.
